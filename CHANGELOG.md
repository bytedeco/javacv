 * Added support for planar audio formats to `FFmpegFrameGrabber` and `FFmpegFrameRecorder`, as required by newer versions of FFmpeg for at least MP3 and AAC
 * Enhanced `FFmpegFrameRecorder` by making it use the closest supported frame rate for the given codec instead of failing
 * To support variable bitrate (VBR) encoding, appended new `videoQuality` and `audioQuality` properties to `FFmpegFrameRecorder`, which usually have an effective range of [0, 51] and overrides the `videoBitrate` and `audioBitrate` properties

### March 3, 2013 version 0.4
 * Upgraded support to OpenCV 2.4.4
 * `CanvasFrame.waitKey(-1)` does not wait anymore and returns the last `KeyEvent` dispatched since the last call to it

 * Added new `RecordActivity.java` Android sample from Shawn Van Every and Qianliang Zhang
 * Added missing `allocate()` methods for `FunctionPointer` in `AVIOContext` and others, which prevented these FFmpeg callbacks from functioning
 * Fixed infinite loop in `FrameGrabber.Array.grab()` (as used by ProCamCalib in the case of stereo cameras, issue #262) when `FrameGrabber.getTimestamp()` returns an invalid negative value (as with `opencv_highgui`) or when using different types of (unsynchronized) `FrameGrabber` together
 * Fixed `cvQueryHistValue_1D()` and other functions that use a raw `CvArr` object

 * Enhanced `FFmpegFrameRecorder` to support conversion between audio sample formats (for the experimental AAC encoder among other things) and to let two different threads call `record(samples)` and `record(image)` simultaneously, plus a couple of other features like `setFrameNumber()`, which lets users skip image frames (achieving variable frame rate)
 * Added a `javacpp.skip` property to `pom.xml`, such that a command like `mvn package -Pall -Djavacpp.skip=true` only recompiles the Java source files, but also added `platform.root` and `compiler.path` properties, which map directly to JavaCPP's for convenience

### July 21, 2012 version 0.2
 * Provided new `javacv-linux-arm.jar` build thanks to Jeremy Nicola (issue #184)

 * Added audio support to `FFmpegFrameGrabber` (call `grabFrame()` instead of `grab()`) and `FFmpegFrameRecorder` (call `setAudioChannels()` before `start()`, and `record(Frame)` instead of `record(IplImage)`) (issue #160)
 * Gave better default `FFmpegFrameRecorder` settings to H.263, MPEG-4, etc. codecs and fixed H.264 encoding with libx264 (issue #160)
 * Refined the `FaceApplet` sample
 * Fixed `FlannBasedMatcher` constructor, `FaceRecognizer.train()`, and `Stitcher.stitch()/composePanorama()` (issue #211)
 * Fixed `CanvasFrame` sometimes blanking out under Windows and maybe Linux (issue #212)

### May 27, 2012 version 0.1
 * Started using version numbers, friendly to tools like Maven, and placing packages in a sort of [Maven repository](http://maven2.javacv.googlecode.com/git/)
 * JavaCV can now extract and load native dependent libraries such as `libopencv_core.so.2.4`, `libopencv_core.2.4.dylib`, `opencv_core240.dll`, etc. from Java resources placed inside the `com.googlecode.javacv.cpp.<platform.name>` package (i.e.: under the `/com/googlecode/javacv/cpp/<platform.name>/` directory of a JAR file in the classpath) (issue #146)
 * Included new `FaceApplet` sample to demonstrate [How to use JavaCV in an applet](http://code.google.com/p/javacv/wiki/HowToMakeAnApplet)
 * Added handy `IplImage.asCvMat()` and `CvMat.asIplImage()` conversion methods

 * Fixed missing parameter from `CvANN_MLP.create()`
 * Added methods `cvCalcCovarMatrixEx()`, `cvEigenDecomposite()`, and `cvEigenProjection()` taking an `IplImage[]` as argument for convenience
 * `VideoInputFrameGrabber.start()` now accepts a `connection` argument such as `VI_COMPOSITE` to support analog cameras and what not
 * Fixed `FaceRecognition` sample (issue #188)
 * Added a few convenience methods to avoid the need to create empty `CvAttrList`

### March 29, 2012

 * Increased versatility of `IplImage.createFrom()`, `copyFrom()`, `copyTo()`, `getBufferedImage()` by providing a `flipChannels` parameter, whose effect was previously mistakenly forced onto four-channel images of byte values only (issue #163)
 * Fixed a couple of things with `CvMat.get()/put()` (issue #167)
 * In addition to an `IplImage`, we may now specify the pixel format of the data when calling `FFmpegFrameRecorder.record()`, but otherwise when `IplImage.nChannels == 2`, it assumes `PIX_FMT_NV21`, allowing for easy and efficient encoding of data captured from the camera on Android (issue #160), image objects we can also convert to RGB using `cvCvtColor()` with `CV_YUV420sp2BGR`
 * Fixed seeking capabilities of `FFmpegFrameGrabber` (issue #162) and added `getLengthInFrames()` and `getLengthInTime()` methods to query the duration of streams, when known
 * Enhanced `IplImage.clone()` and `create*Compatible()` with cloning of their `BufferedImage` to make it easier to keep color components in the right order (issue #163)
 * Refactored `FrameGrabber` and `FrameRecorder` a bit to accommodate new `createDefault(...)` and `create(String className, ...)` factory methods, offering to users an easier selection method to work around limitations of some APIs (issue #70)
 * Adjusted `GNImageAligner`, `ProCamTransformer`, etc. to support alignment of only the projector display on textureless surface planes
 * Renamed a few more `Settings` properties to reflect better their meanings

### February 18, 2012
 * Added `GLCanvasFrame` to show OpenGL renderbuffers on screen, plus a new factory method `JavaCVCL.createCLGLImageFrom()` to create compatible ones from `IplImage` objects, as well as more user-friendly `getGLContext()`, `getGL()` and `getGL2()` methods
 * Fixed various things of the original `CanvasFrame`, and `JavaCV.createCLImage()` and `createIplImage()`, also appending `From` to their names 
 * New `createPinnedBuffer()` and `createPinnedIplImage()` factory methods in `JavaCVCL` to allocate page-locked memory for faster CPU<->GPU transfers, but it does not seem to work for OpenCL image objects, only linear buffer objects :(
 * Fixed and enhanced `GNImageAlignerCL` and `ProjectorDevice` (its `useOpenGL` property) to support fully OpenCL and OpenGL acceleration
 * Refactored `Parallel` a bit so that we may set the number of threads it uses via its static `numThreads` property or the "com.googlecode.javacv.numthreads" system property, which defaults to `Parallel.getNumCores() = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()`
 * Cleaned up and renamed some methods in `JavaCV`, while adding `boundingRect()`, functionally similar to `cvBoundingRect`, but better adapted to compute a properly aligned and padded ROI
 * Inserted a couple of missing `allocate()` inside `opencv_flann`
 * Updated `ObjectFinder` with a `Settings.useFLANN` property to let it use FLANN via OpenCV

 * Moved parallel execution of `cvkernels.multiWarpColorTransform()`, modifying `ImageTransformer` classes, from `GNImageAligner` into `cvkernels`, which now also supports other image types than `float`
 * Renamed some `Settings` properties here and there to correct typos and reflect better their meanings
 * Updated `freenect` to reflect the latest changes of OpenKinect's master branch
 * FFmpeg and other libraries did not work under Android when compiled with the latest NDK, r7 (issue #147): Fixed in JavaCPP
 * Moved `IplImage.timestamp` to `FrameGrabber`, also adding a `frameNumber` property, both allowing to seek within streams too
 * Removed `triggerFlushSize` property from `CameraDevice` and `FrameGrabber`, instead relying on the `numBuffers` property to decide the required size of a buffer flush
 * Corrected the logic behind `FFmpegFrameGrabber.getFrameRate()` and `getTimestamp()` (issue #151)
 * Created a `BufferRing` class for convenient circular rings of large buffers that require manual release of resources, such as OpenCL memory
 * Added a few more useful methods to `FrameGrabber`, including `restart()`, `flush()`, and `delayedGrab()` (to be used in conjunction with `getDelayedTime()` and `getDelayedImage()`)
 * Inserted `cvLoadImageBGRA()` and `cvLoadImageRGBA()` methods into `opencv_highgui` to load color images compatible with OpenCL more easily
 * `JavaCvErrorCallback` now outputs messages to `Logger` instead of `System.err`
 * Defined `VI_COM_MULTI_THREADED` for `videoInput`, allowing it to run on multiple threads if needed

### January 8, 2012
 * JavaCV should now have an easier time automatically finding libraries inside standard directories such as `/usr/local/lib/`, `/opt/local/lib/`, and `C:\opencv\`, even when they are not part of the system configuration or PATH (issue #127)
 * Renamed `set()` and `fill()` methods to `put()` inside `CvPoint*` classes, for better naming consistency
 * Renamed `FrameGrabber.ColorMode` to `ImageMode` and its `BGR` value to `COLOR` to reflect the fact that a `FrameGrabber` instance can return color images in some arbitrary format, but added a new `pixelFormat` property to let users know or specify the exact pixel format desired, such as `PIX_FMT_BGR24`, etc. in the case of `FFmpegFrameGrabber`
 * After `FFmpegFrameGrabber.start()`, the `format`, `imageWidth`, `imageHeight`, and `frameRate` properties switch to their effective values
 * Added new `FrameGrabber.sensorPattern` property to obtain the Bayer filter layout of raw data from `DC1394FrameGrabber` and `FlyCaptureFrameGrabber`
 * Readded to `KDTree`, `Index`, and `HOGDescriptor` some functions with `FloatPointer` and `IntPointer` arguments that were mistakenly removed when OpenCV switched to using `cv::InputArray` and `cv::OutputArray` parameter types (issue #134)
 * Renamed `ProjectiveGainBiasTransformer` to `ProjectiveColorTransformer`
 * Added a few classes to do some processing using OpenCL and OpenGL: `JavaCVCL`, `GNImageAlignerCL`, `ProjectiveTransformerCL`, `ProjectiveColorTransformerCL`, and `ProCamTransformerCL` with some other related files

 * Fixed `IplImage.createFrom()` and `copyFrom()` when called on objects returned by `BufferedImage.getSubimage()`
 * Added missing allocator to `CvRNG`
 * `OpenCVFrameGrabber` now detects when CV_CAP_PROP_POS_MSEC is broken and gives up calling `cvGetCaptureProperty()`

 * JavaCV now exposes all C++ functions and classes of OpenCV not covered by the C API
 * Fixed various erroneous declarations and calls, including those due to changes in JavaCPP

### May 11, 2011
 * Removed `CvMat` object pooling in favor of more efficient `ThreadLocal` objects created by `CvMat.createThreadLocal()`
 * Changed `Marker.getCenter()` back to the centroid, because it has better noise averaging properties and gives in practice more accurate results than the actual center
 * Added hack to `OpenCVFrameGrabber.start()` to wait for `cvRetrieveFrame()` to return something else than `null` under Mac OS X
 * FFmpeg now works properly on Windows and Android (issue #63) with newer binaries
 * New `videoInputLib` wrapper and corresponding `VideoInputFrameGrabber` to capture using DirectShow, useful under Windows 7 where OpenCV and FFmpeg can fail to capture using Video for Windows (issue #58)
 * `GeometricCalibrator` now reports the maximum errors in addition to the average (RMS) errors

### April 7, 2011
 * Added a `format` property to `CameraDevice`, `FrameGrabber`, and `FrameRecorder`, mostly useful for `FFmpegFrameGrabber`, where interesting values include "dv1394", "mjpeg", "video4linux2", "vfwcap", and "x11grab"
 * `OpenCVFrameRecorder` now uses `CV_FOURCC_PROMPT` under Windows as default since `CV_FOURCC_DEFAULT` crashes (issue #49)
 * Added hack to make sure the temporarily extracted library files get properly deleted under Windows
 * JavaCPP now loads classes more lazily
 * Fixed most occurences of `UnsatisfiedLinkError` (issue #54), but some corner cases may require a call to `Loader.load()` on the class one wishes to use
 * Added (rudimentary) outlier detection and modified zero threshold handling in the image alignment framework
 * New `JavaCV.hysteresisThreshold()` feature
 * New `HandMouse` functionality, which depends on the image alignment framework
 * Fixed `ProjectiveDevice.distort()`, which mistakenly undistorted images instead
 * New `HoughLines` sample thanks to Jeremy Nicola

### February 19, 2011
 * Switched from JNA to JavaCPP, which has a lower overhead and supports C++, bringing hope that future versions of JavaCV will support features of OpenCV available only through the C++ API
 * Consequently, the syntax of various operations have changed a bit, but the transition should not be too painful
 * As a happier consequence, this also fixes the problem with SSE instructions on 32-bit x86 (issue #36)
 * Also, JavaCPP does not have any limitations or performance issues with large data structures (issue #10 and issue #14)
 * Added support for OpenCV 2.2 (issue #42), but dropped support for all previous versions
 * Added samples provided by users (issue #1, issue #45, and issue #46)
 * Added deinterlace setting to `FFmpegFrameGrabber` having it call `avpicture_deinterlace()` (issue #38)
 * Enhanced a few things of the image alignment algorithm
 * Tried to fix image format conversion inside `FlyCaptureFrameGrabber`, but this is going to require more careful debugging
 * Fixed and added various other things I forget

### December 2, 2010
 * Now works on Android with the Dalvik VM (for more details, please refer to the FacePreview sample available on the download page)
 * Added more hacks to `CanvasFrame` in the hope to make it behave better outside the EDT
 * Made clearer the error messages thrown from `FrameGrabber` objects, when `start()` may not have been called
 * Fixed version specific declarations of `CvStereoBMState` and related functions
 * Fixed conditions that could crash `cvkernels`

### November 4, 2010
 * Renamed the package namespace to `com.googlecode.javacv`, which makes more sense now that JavaCV has been well anchored at Google Code for more than a year, piggybacking on the unique and easy-to-remember domain name
 * Included new FFmpeg wrapper classes `avutil`, `avcodec`, `avformat`, `avdevice`, `avfilter`, `postprocess`, and `swscale`, eliminating the need of the separate FFmpeg-Java package
 * `CanvasFrame` now redraws its `Canvas` after the user resizes the `Frame`
 * Fixed the `Error` thrown when calling `CanvasFrame.showImage()` from the EDT
 * Added check to `DC1394FrameGrabber` so that a "Failed to initialize libdc1394" does not crash the JVM
 * `FFmpegFrameGrabber` does not crash anymore when forgetting to call `start()` before a `grab()` or `trigger()`
 * `FrameGrabber` now selects the default grabber a bit better
 * Made sweeping changes (for the better, but still not finalized) to `GNImageAligner`, `ProjectiveTransformer`, `ProjectiveGainBiasTransformer`, and `ProCamTransformer`...
 * Added to `JavaCV` more methods related to transformation of planes: `perspectiveTransform()`, `getPlaneParameters()`, `getPerspectiveTransform()`, and `HtoRt()`, as well as `ProjectiveDevice.getFrontoParallelH()`
 * Added a static `autoSynch` flag to all `Structure` classes of `cxcore`, `cv`, and `cvaux`, which you may set to `false` prior to the return of things like big and heavy `CvSeq` to make them load faster and to avoid stack overflows, but accessing fields will then require manual calls to `readField()` and `writeField()` (issue #10 and #14)
 * Added missing `ByValue` subclasses to `CvSeq`, `CvSet`, `CvContourTree`, and `CvChain`... Any others missing?
 * Fixed `Exception` thrown from `cvCreateHist()` under JNA 3.2.7 (issue #26)
 * Enhanced `CvMat.put()`, which now supports setting submatrices
 * Improved inside `IplImage` the support of `BufferedImage`, especially those using a `DirectColorModel` (issue #23)
 * Fixed crash in `cvkernels` when color transformation `X` is `null`

### July 30, 2010
 * Fixed crash that would occur in `CanvasFrame` for some video drivers
 * `FFmpegFrameGrabber` now supports other input formats (devices), such as `x11grab` that can be used for screencasting
 * Added `JavaCV.median()` function, and `JavaCV.fractalTriangleWave()` now respects image ROI
 * Fixed background subtraction in `cvaux`
 * Fixed crash inside the code for direct alignment caused by the ROI getting set outside the image plane
 * Added `deltaScale` and `tryToFixPlane` to `GNImageAligner.Settings` (the first used in `ImageTransformer.Parameters` as increment, randomly selected forward or backward, for finite difference), which sometimes help to jump over local minima

### May 30, 2010

 * Renamed `CanvasFrame.acquireGraphics()` to `createGraphics()` for consistency
 * When `FlyCaptureFrameGrabber` cannot set fastest speed, it now safely fails by setting any supported speed
 * Added a new `Parallel.loop()` method that can use more threads than the number of CPU cores detected
 * Added new `numThreads` property to `GNImageAligner` and fixed a few minor inconsistencies as well
 * Fixed incorrect `Java.HnToRt()`, and added a few `norm()` and `randn()` methods

 * Fixed loading problems with `cvaux`
 * Fixed and enhanced histogram, back projection, and other CAMSHIFT related functionality
 * Added code for `CvRNG`
 * Added "/opt/local/lib/" and "/opt/local/lib64/" (standard on Mac OS X) to the default list of search paths for OpenCV
 * Added `CvScalar.getVal()` and `CvIntScalar.getVal()`, which simply return the `val` field, convenient for Scala where `val` is a reserved word
 * Fixed the construction of `IplImage` from a `Pointer`
 * Removed incorrect cases when an `IplImage` gets converted to a `BufferedImage.TYPE_CUSTOM`
 * Made `CvArr.PointerByReference` a bit more consistent and general

### April 16, 2010
 * Modified `IplImage`, `FrameGrabber`, and `CanvasFrame` to get better default behavior of gamma correction
 * Fixed `cv.CvHistogram` and related histogram functions
 * `CameraDevice.Settings.triggerFlushSize` now defaults to 5 (only affects `OpenCVFrameGrabber` and `FFmpegFrameGrabber`)
 * Replaced `LMImageAligner` by `GNImageAligner`, a more appropriate name for Gauss-Newton with `lineSearch`

 * `CameraDevice.Settings` has a new `deviceFile` property (used by a `FrameGrabber`), which brings up a file dialog for some `PropertyEditor`s
 * Moved in `CameraSettings`, `ProjectorSettings`, and `FrameGrabber.PropertyEditor` from the `procamcalib` package
 * Added to `CameraDevice.Settings` and `FrameGrabber` a `triggerFlushSize` property to indicate the number of buffers to flush on `trigger()` to compensate for cheap cameras that keep old images in memory indefinitely
 * Changed the type of `CameraDevice.Settings.deviceNumber` to `Integer` so we may set it to `null`
 * Fixed and enhanced `CanvasFrame.showImage()` methods a bit
 * In `triggerMode` `DC1394FrameGrabber` now tries to use a real software trigger and only falls back to one-shot mode on error
 * Fixed array constructors of `IplImage.PointerByReference()` and `CvImgObsInfo.PointerByReference()`
 * Added `CvPoint.fillArray()` methods to reuse preallocated arrays and changed `createArray()` a bit as well

### February 13, 2010
 * Relicensed JavaCV under the GPLv2 with Classpath exception (see LICENSE.txt). Please note that if your application links with code that needs ARToolKitPlus, for example, it will become subject to the full GPL, without Classpath exception
 * Added `devicePath` setting to `CameraDevice` that works with `FFmpegFrameGrabber`, `OpenCVFrameGrabber`, and other `FrameGrabber` with a String constructor
 * Added "C:/OpenCV2.0/bin/release/" to the directory list to search for OpenCV DLLs
 * Moved `cvFindHomography()`, `cvFindExtrinsicCameraParams2()`, `cvReprojectImageTo3D()`, `cvSaveImage()`, and `cvRetrieveFrame()` to version specific classes since their number of arguments differ with the version of OpenCV
 * Enhanced `CvMat.put(CvMat mat)` to work better even when the matrices are not actually compatible
 * Added new `IplImage` factory methods `createCompatible(IplImage image)`, `createIfNotCompatible(IplImage image, IplImage template)`, and `createFrom(BufferedImage image)`
 * Fixed `distortionCoeffs` corruption that might occur in `ProjectiveDevice`

### January 3, 2010
 * Added wrapper for the `cvaux` module of OpenCV
 * Added abstract `FrameRecorder` class and a `OpenCVFrameRecorder` class
 * Fixed read() problem that might occur within Pointer constructors
 * Running `java -jar javacv.jar` now displays version information

### December 22, 2009
 * Fixed `CanvasFrame` from getting stuck in a maximized window

 * Added _R2_ correlation coefficient field to `ProjectiveDevice`
 * Enhanced and fixed color conversion spaghetti code in `FlyCaptureFrameGrabber`
 * Fixed the `CvHaarFeature` Structure 
 * Renamed `CvIntScalar` factory methods to match with `CvScalar`
 * Enhanced and fixed some problems with gamma correction in `IplImage`
 * Added a `highgui.CV_FOURCC()` method that takes chars as parameter
 * Moved `MarkedPlane.drawMarkers()` to `Marker.draw()` for better code reuse
 * Added `MarkedPlane.getTotalWarp()` with a "useCenters" parameter
 * Changed default values of `MarkerDetector.binarizationKWhiteMarkers` to 1.0 and `ProjectorDevice.brightnessBackground` to 0.0
 * Fixed issue with image width and memory alignment in `MarkerDetector`
 * `Marker.getCenter()` now computes the actual physical center instead of the centroid
 * `OpenCVFrameGrabber.getDeviceDescriptions()` now throws `UnsupportedOperationException`
 * Added support in `OpenCVFrameGrabber` to grab frames from video files
 * Added `ProjectiveDevice.getRectifyingHomography()` method
 * Added `JavaCvErrorCallback` to easily catch errors of OpenCV in Java

### October 19, 2009
 * Moved the functionality of `CvMatPool` to the `CvMat.take()` and `.pool()` methods
 * Added color calibration for projector-camera systems (`ProCamColorCalibrator`)
 * Updated `DC1394FrameGrabber` to handle more conversion use cases automatically
 * Fixed `CvIntScalar` to mirror `CvScalar`

### October 14, 2009
 * Change of plan: JavaCV now works with any of OpenCV 1.0, 1.1pre1, or 2.0! Version specific functionality is enclosed in subclasses, e.g., the class `cv.v20` can access everything from the `cv` module of OpenCV 2.0
 * Added a few missing functions and adjusted some mappings to make them closer to the C API
 * Added a few more helper methods to `CvPoint*`
 * Added temporary storage to `ObjectFinder` to plug the memory leak

### October 2, 2009
 * Fixed problem when loading distortion coefficients with `ProjectiveDevice`
 * Added automatic read and write for functions with arrays of `Structure` or `PointerByReference`
 * Added to `cv.java` a few missing functions related to calibration
 * Fixed up a bit helper methods for `CvPoint*`, `CvScalar`, `CvRect`, `CvBox2D`, `CvMat`, `IplImage`, `CvMemStorage`, `CvSeq`, and `CvSeqBlock`
 * Added `CvMatPool` to `MarkedPlane` and `Marker`
 * Added a few new `distort()` methods to `ProjectiveDevice`
 * Last version to support OpenCV 1.1pre1: Future version will require OpenCV 2.0
