**1. target**

  make those android samples tidy and easy to get and use。
        

**2. to-do**

1. <strike>classify those samples</strike>
2. provide pack-to-use projects for each sample.
3. provide 2 versions [ AS and Eclipse ] for android samples

**3. Samples Classification**

1. RecorderActivity
2. FacePreview

**4. RecorderActivity--Eclipse**

1. to set up a eclipse project,you need to put the `openffmpeg.jar`、`javacpp.jar`、`javacv.jar`、`opencv.jar`
into the dir `/libs`.and extract the jars thar names like`xx-platform`  into `/libs/armeabi`. This is weird. But Samuel Audet said these  jar files which name like `xx-platform` and `xx` can appear in one project at the same time.  

**5. RecorderActivity--Android studio**

to-do
