/**
 * Defines two methods to convert between a {@link Frame} and another generic
 * data object that can contain the same data. The idea with this design is
 * to allow users to convert easily between multiple potentially mutually
 * exclusive types of image data objects over which we have no control. Because
 * of this, and for performance reasons, any object returned by this class is
 * guaranteed to remain valid only until the next call to {@code convert()},
 * anywhere in a chain of {@code FrameConverter} objects, and only as long as
 * the latter themselves are not closed or garbage collected.
